Previously, he worked 3 years at EADS, including working as a core member of EADS IW, then created the SOGETI ESEC R&D (lab) team he managed for 5 years. He also is founder of the french conference SSTIC and magazine MISC. Beside \"founding\", he enjoys both technical hacking, information warfare and finding ways to combine both in order to find different (and hopefully better) ways to do information security.\r\n#### [Emilien Girault](https://twitter.com/emiliengirault) \r\nEmilien Girault is a security auditor and pentester at ANSSI (French Network and Information Security Agency). His     main fields of interest include vulnerability exploitation, cryptography and reverse engineering of PLC firmwares and     client-server applications. He enjoys participating in various security challenges, such as SSTIC and NoSuchCon. He's the author of several articles published on old blogs like Ghosts In The Stack and Sogeti ESEC, as well as DOAR-E and French magazine MISC.\r\n#### [Axel '0vercl0k' Souchet](https://twitter.com/0vercl0k)\r\nAxel Souchet is a fresh CS graduate who recently joined Microsoft and the MSRC team as a security software engineer. He basically loves computers, challenges, and low level subjects: bug hunting, code-obfuscation, weird machines, etc. He is also not really good at writing Bio as you can see.\r\n#### [Jonathan 'Djo' Salwan](https://twitter.com/JonathanSalwan)\r\nJonathan Salwan is a junior security researcher at Quarkslab who has a strong interest in low-level computing and program analysis. His research is mostly focused on both static and dynamic program analysis. \r\n#### [Mariano 'Emdel' Graziano](https://twitter.com/emd3l)\r\nMariano Graziano is currently a Ph.D. student at the Software and System Security group of Institut Eurecom in Sophia-Antipolis. In his thesis, he tries to protect the world by developing new automated techniques to analyze malware and to defeat chaos in physical memory dumps.\r\n#### [Aurélien 'Dad' Wailly](https://twitter.com/awailly)\r\nAurélien Wailly is an engineer in cloud computing security at Orange Labs. His primary research interest is the application of autonomic concepts to adapt security to cloud environments. He also studies underlying virtualization security to lower attack surface and provide remediation.\r\n#### [Florian 'Mysterie' Ledoux](https://twitter.com/Myst3rie)\r\nMr. Florian Ledoux ([@Myst3rie](https://twitter.com/Myst3rie)) is a security researcher at Vupen. Mr Ledoux has been a team member of the EADS IW security team for 2 years. He is interested in producing ongoing cutting-edge research in the area of application and operating system security. Passionate of fuzzing, vulnerability discovery and analysis. Mr Ledoux also has authored white papers about dropbox security and was invited to present his work at HACK.LU  and APPSEC.CH  conferences. He also authored analysis of windows vulnerabilities on the french magazine MISC and on his blog mysterie.fr .","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
