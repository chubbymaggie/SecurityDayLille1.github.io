He basically loves computers, challenges, and low level subjects: bug hunting, code-obfuscation, weird machines, etc. Axel is one of the owners of the DOAR-E project. On his spare time, he tries to learn about the jedi arts. He is also not really good at writing Bio as you can see. \r\n#### [Jonathan 'Djo' Salwan](https://twitter.com/JonathanSalwan)\r\nJonathan Salwan is a junior security researcher at Quarkslab who has a strong interest in low-level computing and program analysis. His research is mostly focused on both static and dynamic program analysis. \r\n#### [Mariano 'Emdel' Graziano](https://twitter.com/emd3l)\r\nMariano Graziano is currently a Ph.D. student at the Software and System Security group of Institut Eurecom in Sophia-Antipolis. In his thesis, he tries to protect the world by developing new automated techniques to analyze malwares and to defeat chaos in physical memory dumps.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
